# Will You Survive?
This is my final grade 12 project that I co-developed with a friend. <br/>
<br/>
Will You Survive❓ <br/>
<br/>
🦠 A deathly virus has overtaken the city <br/>
🏃‍♀️ You play as one of the sole survivors of an apocalypse <br/>
✭  The objective of the game is to: <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 🗺️ Use the map to understand what buildings you're supposed to explore <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 🏘️ Accomplish the given tasks in each building <br/>
