# Will You Survive?
This is my final grade 12 project that I co-developed with a friend.

Will You Survive?
🦠 A deathly virus has overtaken the city 
🏃‍♀️ You play as one of the sole survivors of an apocalypse 
✭  The objective of the game is to: 
      - 🗺️ Use the map to understand what buildings you're supposed to explore
      - 🏘️ Accomplish the given tasks in each building 
      - 🏚️ Find the other group of survivors and join them
